# Run From Me - Mini Java Adventure Game

## Overview

"Run From Me" is a mini Java game where you guide a character through a maze-like map. You control a character, the blue ball, which responds to your mouse's position.
The map is filled with obstacles represented by black balls and open spaces that allow free movement. A smart enemy, the red ball, constantly pursuing the player, adds to the challenge.
This project was developed to explore and implement various programming concepts such as the A* Search Algorithm, Java Swing for GUI development, and multithreading in Java.

## What's Inside?

- **Your Character**: It's a blue ball that follows your mouse around. Simple, right?
- **The Enemy**: There's this other ball that's always chasing you. Keep away from it!
- **The Map**: Black balls are walls, and the open spaces are your playground.
- **Controls**: Just use your mouse. Left-click to start or pause the game, and right-click to give it another go!
