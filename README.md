# Run from me

The "Run from me" application is a project where the user has a character (blue ball) that moves 
accordingly to the mouse position on the map. The map is composed by walls represented with black balls,
and free positions that allows the characters to walk there. Beyond the user, there is an enemy that 
follows the user and tries to get him. On the map, the enemy's track to catch the user.

This is just a personal project (with some problems and bugs) to allow me to practice concepts like 
A* Algorithm, Java Swing, threads, ...

## Commands

* Mouse's left button - Start/pause game.
* Mouse's right button - Restart game.
